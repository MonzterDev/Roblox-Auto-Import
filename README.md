## üöÄ Coming Soon
* **Enhanced Comments**: Use comments to populate the import suggestion info window.
* **Smart Updating**: Renaming or moving a Module Script? All require statements will be updated, with notifications for any issues.
* **Code Samples**: Module import suggestions will include all public members (properties / methods) in the code sample.
* **Customizable Naming**: Tailor imported module variable names to your needs. Example: All modules required in the ServerScriptService can end with Manager. Or maybe even be able to add suffix to name from the parent they're stored in. (Module named Pets stored inside a Folder named Config would be imported as "PetsConfig")
* **Nested Module Properties**: Use a property inside nested module scripts to indicate which should be required instead of the first module

## ‚ùì Frequently-Asked-Questions

### How do I use it?
Once you have the plugin installed and activated, you can open a script and begin typing out the name of the Module Script or Service you want to import. As you type, you'll begin to see different imports suggested. Hit enter on whatever import you want and a variable will be created for it towards the top of your script.

### Denied Script Injection Permission
If you get this error, it most likely means you declined the permission request when prompted after installing the plugin. You should be able to reopen the game and be prompted again.
